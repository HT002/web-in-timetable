There are several methods to create an HTML button that acts as a link. Some of them are discussed below:
Note: Adding basic CSS property to the button in every method to make button looks better.


Using onclick Event: The onclick event attribute works when the user click on the button. When mouse clicked on the button then the button acts like a link and redirect page into the given location.
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
      
<head>
    <title>
        Create an HTML button that
        acts like a link
    </title>
      
    <!-- Style to create button -->
    <style>
        .GFG {
            background-color: white;
            border: 2px solid black;
            color: green;
            padding: 5px 10px;
            text-align: center;
            display: inline-block;
            font-size: 20px;
            margin: 10px 30px;
            cursor: pointer;
        }
    </style>
</head>
  
<body>
    <h1>GeeksforGeeks</h1>
      
    <!-- Adding link to the button on the onclick event -->
    <button class="GFG" 
    onclick="window.location.href = '

';">
        Click Here
    </button>
</body>
  
</html>
